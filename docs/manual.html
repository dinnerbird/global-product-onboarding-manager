        <h2 id="i-system-overview">I. System Overview </h2>
        <p>PATHWAY is a standalone employee training tracing system designed to improve the<br>
            training preparation process for the Global Products Team at Enterprise Mobility.</p>
        <p>The system provides a centralized platform where managers can assign training tasks, track employee
            progress,
            and generate complete reports, while employees can easily view and complete and report their
            required
            training. PATHWAY was created to replace the Global Products department's previous manual
            process.<br>
            By using PATHWAY, Enterprise Mobility aims to improve training accountability, reduce administrative
            workload, and ensure that employees are properly prepared for their roles.</p>
        <p>PATHWAY is a secure, web-based application that does not require integration with Enterprise's
            internal
            infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Access is limited to <strong>authorized Enterprise Mobility employees</strong>, with managers
            responsible for
            creating employee accounts. The system supports distinct user roles — including "HR" and "New"
            employees of
            the Global products Department — ensuring each user only sees the tools and data relevant to their
            role.</p>
        <h2 id="ii-application-overview">II. Application Overview </h2>
        <p>This section outlines the primary features and functionality available within the PATHWAY system.</p>
        <p>The PATHWAY system is a browser-based application with a user-friendly interface that supports two
            main user
            roles: Management and Employee. Managers can add employees, assign training tasks, track progress,
            and
            generate reports, while employees log in to view and log their completed assigned training. All
            system
            functionality is accessed via secure login, and navigation is designed to be easy to use for
            non-technical
            users.</p>
        <p>The following sections provide visual guidance for logging in, managing training records, and using
            PATHWAY's
            core features.</p>
        <h2 id="21-login-page">2.1 Login Page </h2>
        <p>Access to the PATHWAY system is restricted to administrative users. Each admin must enter a valid
            username
            and password to log in. All passwords are securely hashed and salted using bcrypt encryption
            standards to
            protect user credentials. Once authenticated, users are redirected to the dashboard where core
            features can
            be accessed.</p>
        <h2 id="22-dashboard-interface">2.2 Dashboard Interface </h2>
        <p>The dashboard serves as the central workspace for all user actions. From this interface,
            administrators can
            manage employee records, view training progress, and interact with uploaded training materials. The
            layout
            is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing quick access to all primary functions.</p>
        <p>There are two main user login types: Managers and Employees.</p>
        <h4 id="221-manager-dashboard">2.2.1 Manager Dashboard: </h4>
        <p>Within the PATHWAY management dashboard, managers have the ability to add and edit employee profiles,
            monitor
            individual training progress, and generate PDF reports summarizing completion status and assigned
            tasks.</p>
        <h4 id="222-new-employee-dashboard">2.2.2 New Employee Dashboard </h4>
        <p>The PATHWAY Employee Dashboard provides new hires with a personalized view of their assigned training
            tasks.
            Employees are greeted with a personalized interface that lists their outstanding training modules,
            categorized by training type. Users can select training categories to filter module types, mark
            items as
            completed, and track their own progress</p>
        <h3 id="23-addedit-employees">2.3 Add/Edit Employees </h3>
        <p>The add and edit employees interface allows managers to easily create, update, or deactivate employee
            profiles within the PATHWAY system. When onboarding a new hire, managers can enter essential
            information
            such as name, job title, email address, etc. to create a new employee profile for the system.</p>
        <p>For existing employees, the edit employee interface provides a quick way to update roles, correct
            information, and adjust access as needed. The layout minimizes errors and ensures that all employee
            records
            remain accurate and up to date.</p>
        <h3 id="24-generate-reports">2.4 Generate Reports </h3>
        <p>The PATHWHAY system includes a built-in reporting feature that allows managers to generate
            professional,
            print-ready PDF reports summarizing employee training progress. These reports display key details
            such as
            complete tasks, outstanding assignments, and training categories. This functionality is useful for
            internal
            documentation, performance reviews, and client-facing updates that require proof of training
            completion.
            Managers can export accurate, up-to-date information without manually compiling spreadsheets or
            emails,
            saving time and minimizing admin overhead.</p>

        <h2 id="iii-system-navigation--user-instructions">III. System Navigation &amp; User instructions </h2>
        <p>The PATHWAY Training Tracking System has been designed with ease of use in mind, offering a
            straightforward
            navigation structure and intuitive user actions. All functions are accessible via the main dashboard
            once an
            admin user logs in.</p>
        <h3 id="31-login-screen">3.1. Login Screen </h3>
        <p>The login screen is the entry point for all authorized suers of the PATHWAY Training Tracking system,
            including both Managers and New Employees</p>

                <p>If an employee is unable to log in to Pathway, start by verifying whether they have access to
                    the
                    system.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>You can do this by searching for their name on the Manager Dashboard or in the “Edit
                            Employees” interface.</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the employee is not in the system, add them as a user through the “Edit Employees”
                    interface. Once
                    their profile is created, login credentials are automatically generated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The username is the <strong>employee's first and last name</strong> (no spaces or special
                    characters).</p>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once the account is created, the manager can share these credentials with the employee. If login
            problems
            continue, ensure the credentials are entered correctly and that there are no typos in the employee's
            profile.</p>
