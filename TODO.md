# Stupidly important
~~[x] Create an Excel file with a bunch of bogus names (as proof of concept)...and figure out a way to turn it into a more appropriate CSV file~~
[x] So instead of using a CSV file, I've implemented a MySQL backend to handle the data
[x] Assign HR and "new" employee metadata. Some sort of labeling system involved there
[x] Write the darn HTML
[ ] Write README

# Components
- Training Material Manager:
    [ ] Training progress tracking
    [ ] HR can facilitate requests to track progress of new employees
    [ ] Curates and hands out training deliverables to new employees
- Employee Manager:
    [x] Add/remove/modify employee data
    [ ] Prepare requests for onboarding
- Authentication Manager:
    [ ] Username/password handling
    [ ] Can identify the difference between HR "admins", new employees, and existing employees

## Knowledge
[ ] As much as JS pisses me off personally, I know it
[ ] Daniel and Adam said they were going to handle the DB stuff
[ ] Smit has Java experience apparently
[ ] Need to look into capabilities for Chido and Kennedy, see what they know

## Less important
[ ] Pretty up the web page itself
